<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I‚Äôm Jingran Zhang, an undergraduate student at Jiangnan University, affiliated with the Key Laboratory of Advanced Process Control for Light Industry, Ministry of Education. Since July 2024, I have been a visiting student in the Motor and Motion-Control Laboratory at ShanghaiTech University, under the supervision of Prof. Jiahao Chen.

I am interested in neural networks, deep learning, invariant extended Kalman filtering, robotic reinforcement learning, and nonlinear control. Currently, I have published two articles, with two more currently under submission. For more details, please refer to my CV and publications.

I am seeking Master/PhD opportunities in control science and engineering for the 2026 semester.
